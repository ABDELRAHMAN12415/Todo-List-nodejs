# üõ†Ô∏è DevOps Project: Automated Deployment with Ansible, Docker, and Watchtower

This project demonstrates a CI/CD workflow using **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, **Ansible**, and **Watchtower**, deployed on an **AWS EC2** instance.

---

## üì¶ Project Stack

- **Node.js App** (sample)
- **MongoDB Atlas** (remote DB)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Ansible** (for provisioning & deployment)
- **Watchtower** (for auto-updates)
- **GitHub Actions** (for CI/CD)

---

## üöÄ Tasks & Steps

### 1. Dockerizing the App

- Dockerfile created to run a simple Node.js app
- `.dockerignore` updated to exclude unnecessary files like `node_modules`, `.env`, and Ansible config
- App exposes port `4000` inside container

---

### 2. Creating and Pushing Docker Image

- GitHub Actions used to:
  - Build image from source
  - Tag with both `latest` and `commit SHA`
  - Push to Docker Hub

---

### 3. Secure MongoDB Credentials

- Used **Ansible Vault** to encrypt MongoDB URI
- No `.env` file included in the container
- URI passed as an environment variable at runtime


---

### 4. Provisioning EC2 Instance

- Ansible playbook provisions EC2 with:
  - Docker & Docker Compose
  - Adds EC2 user to Docker group

---

### 5. Deploying with Docker Compose

- Ansible copies `docker-compose.yml` and runs it
- Mongo URI injected securely via environment variable
- Ports mapped as `80:4000` for public access
-

---

### 7. Health Checks

- Added Docker health check to ensure app is running
- Checks `http://localhost:4000` every 30 seconds

---

### 6. Auto-Updating with Watchtower

- Watchtower container deployed with Docker Compose
- Monitors and auto-updates app container on new image push

## üåê Final Result

The app is available on the EC2 public IP at [port 80 ](http://13.61.147.28/)  for some time

## üìù Notes

- MongoDB used is hosted externally (MongoDB Atlas)
- bonus Kubernetes task was skipped as it was hard to install on freetier t2.micro instance
